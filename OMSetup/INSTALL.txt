There are two installation files:

 - setup.exe will install the appropriate version of the .NET
   framework on your machine, over the internet.  If you already
   have the appropriate version, you can skip this file.

 - OMSetup.msi will install OpenMedIC on your machine:
   - OpenMedIC.dll
   - Other required DLLs (go into %system32%)
   - Source code
